    # To avoid long times and high resource usage, we assume that:
    # 1. The setuptools APIs used by packages don't vary too much with OS or
    #    Python implementation
    # 2. Any circumstance for which the previous assumption is not valid is
    #    already tested via unit tests (or other tests not classified here as
    #    "integration")
    # With that in mind, the integration tests can run for a single setup
